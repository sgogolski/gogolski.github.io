## Description of Image Analysis

At this time, I do not see image analysis playing a role in a future project of mine. However, I have learned a significant amount about how images are analyzed and the challenges involved in the process. One of the key takeaways for me is the technical complexity and attention to detail that image analysis often requires.

For someone like me, who finds learning new types of computer software to be daunting, this can present a real barrier. Many software tools used in image analysis require users to perform a sequence of operations in a very specific order. If one step is done incorrectly or out of sequence, it can cause the entire process to fail, which can be both frustrating and time-consuming.

Additionally, even when a step-by-step guide is available, there are further complications related to the type of computer one uses. Instructions that work perfectly on a Windows machine may not work on a Mac, and vice versa, due to differences in file systems, operating environments, and software compatibility.

I reviewed a paper by Zhao, C., Fezzaa, K., Cunningham, R. W., Wen, H., De Carlo, F., Sun, T., & Rollett, A. D. (2017), titled *Real-time monitoring of laser powder bed fusion process using high-speed X-ray imaging and diffraction*, published in *Scientific Reports*, volume 7, article number 3602. [Link to paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03761-2)

This paper focused on analyzing high-speed X-ray imaging sequences to study the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process used in additive manufacturing. From the images provided, the authors collected data on several aspects of the LPBF process, including melt pool dynamics, keyhole formation, pore formation and motion, as well as spatter and particle ejection. These are all critical components in understanding the quality and consistency of metal 3D printing.

However, despite the rich imagery and detailed discussion of the phenomena observed, the paper did not provide specific information about the image analysis techniques used. There was no mention of the software platforms or custom scripts involved, nor were there any technical specifications such as threshold values, segmentation methods, or filtering parameters. This lack of detail makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for other researchers to reproduce or build upon their analysis. It also highlights the importance of transparency and documentation in scientific work, particularly when complex digital tools are involved.
